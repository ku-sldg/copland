title: Tampering Paper
---

New paper out from our colleagues at MITRE: [Evidence Tampering and
Chain of Custody in Layered Attestations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00203)
complete with
[Coq sources](https://github.com/mitre/copland/tree/main/src/tampering). The
paper examines evidence custody chains in remote attestation with the
goal of identifying all tampering opportunities. The ultimate goal
being trust in the evidence used for appraisal.

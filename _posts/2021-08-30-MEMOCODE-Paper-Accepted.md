"Design and Formal Verification of a Copland-based Attestation
Protocol" by Adam Petz, Grant Jurgensen, and Perry Alexander has been accepted for
publication at the *MEMOCODE '21* conference, Nov 20-22, to be held
virtually. This paper introduces a workflow for both analyzing and executing
Copland-based attestation protocols in the context of a security
architecture.  It concludes by instantiating that workflow with a
concrete architecture and layered attestation protocol
designed for a DARPA CASE demonstration platform that hosts a legacy
UAV flight control application.  Download a pdf of the paper from the [publications page](https://ku-sldg.github.io/copland/publications.html).

<p>The Copland phrase below is an enrichment of the previous one in which
the bank receives the final evidence even as the client begins the
mutual attestation by requesting evidence from the bank.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>*bank: @client @bank [attest bank sys] -&gt; prove client id
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The bank begins by requesting that the client request the bank perform
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">attest</code> measurement locally on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sys</code>.  After receiving this
measurement, the client performs the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prove</code> measurement locally on
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">id</code> and returns this result to the bank.</p>

<p>Why do we need this indirection to obtain the attestation structure we
want?  The current Copland implementation adopts the convention that
the initiating place, in this case <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bank</code>, always receives the final
evidence.  In this client-bank scenario, however, the place initially
requesting attestation and the place that receives the final evidence
are different.</p>

<p>In order to obtain the attestation structure we want, given this
convention, we might pursue two approaches:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The one chosen here, in which the bank in fact makes the first
request, which consists of a request to the client to begin the
attestation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Introducing a “ghost” principal that requests the client begin the
attestation and collects the final evidence.  Under this approach, one
ignores the series of replies that propagate the final evidence back
up to the ghost.  We consider this approach in the next example</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The final evidence type produced by this phrase has the form</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>m(msp(prove, client, id), client, m(msp(attest, bank, sys), bank, mt))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is identical to the evidence produced by the previous two phrases.</p>

<p>Outstanding concerns:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We would also like to be able to represent the client’s appraisal
explicitly</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this phrase, the final evidence received by the bank contains
the bank’s own attestation as an input. In our scenario, the bank
should receive some form of credential from the client whose value
is independent of the bank’s earlier evidence</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Before continuing to address these concerns, our next example will
consider the ghost principal approach to obtaining the desired
request-reply structure.</p>

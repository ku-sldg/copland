  <h2>Abstract</h2>

  <p>Copland Attestation Terms (CATs) provide a means
  for specifying layered attestations.  The terms are designed to
  bridge the gap between formal analysis of attestation security
  guarantees and concrete implementations.  We therefore provide two
  semantic interpretations of terms in our language.  The first is a
  denotational semantics in terms of partially ordered sets of events.
  This directly connects CATs to prior work on layered attestation.
  The second is an operational semantics detailing how the data and
  control flow are executed.  This gives explicit implementation
  guidance for attestation frameworks.</p>

  <p>This document is generated from Coq sources that contain the
  proofs of the connection between the two semantics ensuring that any
  execution according to the operational semantics is consistent with
  the denotational event semantics.  This ensures that formal
  guarantees resulting from analyzing the event semantics will hold
  for executions respecting the operational semantics.</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>Copland Attestation Terms (CATs) provide a means
    for specifying layered attestations.  The terms are designed to
    bridge the gap between formal analysis of attestation security
    guarantees and concrete implementations.  We therefore provide two
    semantic interpretations of terms in our language.  The first is a
    denotational semantics in terms of partially ordered sets of
    events.  This directly connects CATs to prior work on layered
    attestation.  The second is an operational semantics detailing how
    the data and control flow are executed.  This gives explicit
    implementation guidance for attestation frameworks.</p>

  <p>This document is generated from a set of proof scripts for the
    Coq proof assistant.
    Library <a href="html/Copland.Preamble.html">Copland.Preamble</a>
    contains a few tactics that are used throughout the proofs that
    follow.
    Library <a href="html/Copland.More_lists.html">Copland.More_lists</a>
    contains facts about generic lists in Coq.  Many of the lemmas are
    in support of particular proofs, so the motivation for some is
    obscure.  A notable exception is the definition and lemmas about
    whether an element <var>x</var> is <em>earlier</em>
    than <var>y</var> in list <var>l</var>.  This will be used to
    discuss event orderings in traces.  A trace is a list of
    events.</p>

  <p>Library <a href="html/Copland.Term.html">Copland.Term</a> precisely
    specifies CATs and the events that are generated when an CAT is
    executed.  The script also defines annotated terms.  To properly
    distinguish events, each event is associated with a natural
    number.  Annotated terms are used to produce unique natural
    numbers for events.</p>

  <p>Library <a href="html/Copland.Event_system.html">Copland.Event_system</a>
    shows our representation of strict partially ordered sets of
    abstract events.  The events are only required to have a function
    that produces its natural number.  Proofs include a demonstration
    that the relation used to order events is, in fact, a strict
    partial order.
    Library <a href="html/Copland.Term_system.html">Copland.Term_system</a>
    specializes the event system to the case of CATs and their
    events.</p>

  <p>Library <a href="html/Copland.Trace.html">Copland.Trace</a> defines a
    big-step semantics for CATs.  The semantics associates a term, a
    place, and some initial evidence with a trace.  The semantics is
    specified inductively, mirroring the structure of CATs.  The
    chapter concludes by showing that the order of events in a trace
    specified by the big-step semantics is compatible with the partial
    order given by the CAT event system.</p>

  <p>Library <a href="html/Copland.LTS.html">Copland.LTS</a> defines a
    small-step semantics for CATs using a labeled transition system
    (LTS).  The proofs in this chapter demonstrate that the LTS (1)
    computes the correct evidence associated with a term; (2) can
    always proceed unless it is in a halt state; and (3) always
    terminates.</p>

  <p>Library <a href="html/Copland.Main.html">Copland.Main</a> contains a
    proof of the main theorem of this work: a trace generated by the
    small-step semantics is compatible with the partial order given by
    the associated CAT event system.  The main lemma is that every
    trace generated by the small-step semantics is a trace of the
    big-step semantics.</p>
